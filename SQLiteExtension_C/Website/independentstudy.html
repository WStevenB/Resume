My name is Steve Babcock, and I'm a student at Indiana University pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science <br>
As an independent study project, I've implemented a couple new ideas into the source code of SQLite <br><br><br><br>
FORECAST - new keyword aiming for more concise and efficient queries<br>
<A HREF = "forecast.php">LEARN MORE</A><br><br><br><br>
Random Keyword Tokenization - new security measure preventing common SQL injection attacks<br>
<A HREF = "signin.php">LEARN MORE</A><br><br><br><br>
